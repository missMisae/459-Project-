# Title: Using DJango based Web Application
  
# Status: ACCEPTED 

# Context: An app has been built with CRUD operations using Django. Since Django is versatile and scalable, it should not be difficult to scale our application into a full product before the next sprint. The team has had some trouble connecting the app to the database, but this too will be solved by next sprint. 

# Consequences: This is a new language for the team, so there may be a learning curve. However, there is a lot of documentation out there for DJango because it is so popular.
