Sprint 1

# Title: Decision of MySQL Database Management System

# Status: accepted

# Context: MySQL Docker containers are ready and available in the Docker Container Hub, making it an easy to use environment.

MySQL vs. MariaDB
    MySQl is a relational database that uses tables, contraints, triggers, roles, stored procedures and contains an indentical set of columns. It uses primary keys to identify each row in a table uniquely and uses foreign keys to make certain of the denotative principles between tables of relation.	MariaDB, however, is a split of MySQL and shares its structure. Therefore one may switch between MySQL and MariaDB without modifying any data since the applications and structures won't have to change, meaning one could just use MySQL in all entirety.

# Consequences: Minimal effort is required to make the environment operational; which is perplexed since it can make the process become more easier or more difficult to be operational because of this change

Sprint 2

# Title: Tables in Database

# Status: ACCEPTED 

# Context: A database created for the pet store with a table consisting of an id as a primary key, animal type column, breed column, name column, age column, and location column. 

# Consequences: It might be better to make a seperate table for some of the attributes for future development.

Sprint 3 (Final)

# Title: Tables in Database

# Status: accepted

# Context: A MySQL database tailored for the "pet store / animal shelter" consisting of a table with the values of 'id' as PRIMARY KEY, 'animal type' column, 'breed' column, 'name' column, 'age' column, and 'location' column.

# Consequences: Minimal effort is required to make the environment operational; which is perplexed since it can make the process become more easier or more difficult to be operational because of this change. Also if we decide to make any developments in the future, it might be better to use multiple tables for the variety of different possible attributes.
