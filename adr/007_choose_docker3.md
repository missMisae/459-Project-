# Title: Choice on continuing using Docker Containers

# Status: DENIED

# Context: Due to the functionality and flexiblilty that our application provides along with our limited knowledge about Docker Containers, we felt that Dockerizing our application should be done at a later time.

# Consequences: Because we did not choose to Dockerize our application we did miss out on some of the benefits a Dockerized Container would offer such as being 'light-weight', 'portable', however the application is still easy to manage.
