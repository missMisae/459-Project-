Sprint 1

# Title: Using Docker Containers 

# Status: ACCEPTED 

# Context: A docker container is necessary to fufill the requirements of the assignment 

	* The benefits of employing Docker containers when builidng applications include... 
	  * **Isolation:** if something in the mySQL container breaks, the application is still intact
	  * **Portability:** applications and dependencies can be bundled inside the container allowing, them to be moved to different machines easily. 
	  * **light-weight:** Docker containers are small allowing for speedy delivery of applications. 
	  
	* Docker vs. Virtual Machines 
	  * Docker containers *share* libraries with the host machine
	  * VM's are more isolated- they do not share libraries with the host machine or any hardware. This gives VM's the benefit of an extra layer of security. 
	  * VM's come with an operating system making them heavy-weight. Thus, docker has the advantage of being more light-weight. 
	  * applications run in Docker are faster
	  
# Consequences: No real consequences besides abstraction and incorporating new tools. Docker is a useful tool for building applications and deploying applicaitons on other machines.

Sprint 2

# Title: Using Docker Containers 

# Status: ACCEPTED 

# Context: Docker containers will be built for the next sprint. This sprint was spent creating functionality in the application. Now that the application has some functionality, it can be Dockerized for the next sprint.

Sprint 3 (Final)

# Title: Choice on continuing using Docker Containers

# Status: denied

# Context: Due to the functionality and flexiblilty that our application provides along with the brief intermediate-level knowledge we've gained about Docker Containers, we felt no need to Dockerize our application.

# Consequences: Because we did not choose to Dockerize our application we did miss out on some of the benefits a Dockerized Container would offer such as being 'light-weight', 'portable', and etc; however the application is still easy to manage.
