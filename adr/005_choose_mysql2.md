# Title: Tables in Database

# Status: ACCEPTED 

# Context: A database created for the pet store with a table consisting of an id as a primary key, animal type column, breed column, name column, age column, and location column. 

# Consequences: It might be better to make a seperate table for some of the attributes for future development.
