# Title: Using Django based Web Application

# Status: ACCEPTED

# Context: Overall - (A web application is necessary to fufill requirements of our assisgnment therefore we built an app with CRUD operations using Django web framework.) Since the last sprint we have developed a full product and solved the error of connecting the app to our database, therefore we have concluded with a full working application ready to be presented.

# Consequences: This is still a new language for the team so a couple of the team members had trouble with their PC appeasing to the requirements to run the application, however, the application does run succesfully on the others'.
