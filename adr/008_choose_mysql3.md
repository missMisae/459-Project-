# Title: Tables in Database

# Status: ACCEPTED

# Context: A MySQL database tailored for the "pet store / animal shelter" consisting of a table with the values of 'id' as PRIMARY KEY, 'animal type' column, 'breed' column, 'name' column, 'age' column, and 'location' column.

# Consequences: Minimal effort is required to make the environment operational; which is perplexed since it can make the process become more easier or more difficult to be operational because of this change. Also if we decide to make any developments in the future, it might be better to use multiple tables for the variety of different possible attributes.
