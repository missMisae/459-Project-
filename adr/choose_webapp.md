Sprint 2

# Title: Using DJango based Web Application
  
# Status: ACCEPTED 

# Context: An app has been built with CRUD operations using Django. Since Django is versatile and scalable, it should not be difficult to scale our application into a full product before the next sprint. The team has had some trouble connecting the app to the database, but this too will be solved by next sprint. 

# Consequences: This is a new language for the team, so there may be a learning curve. However, there is a lot of documentation out there for DJango because it is so popular.

Sprint 3 (Final)

# Title: Using Django based Web Application

# Status: accepted

# Context: Overall - (A web application is necessary to fufill requirements of our assisgnment therefore we built an app with CRUD operations using Django web framework.) Since the last sprint we have developed a full product and solved the error of connecting the app to our database, therefore we have concluded with a full working application ready to be presented.

# Consequences: This is still a new language for the team so a couple of the team members had trouble with their PC appeasing to the requirements to run the application, however, the application does run succesfully on the others'.
