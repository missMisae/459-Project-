# Title: Using Docker Containers 

# Status: ACCEPTED 

# Context: Docker containers will be built for the next sprint. This sprint was spent creating functionality in the application. Now that the application has some functionality, it can be Dockerized for the next sprint.
	  
# Consequences: No real consequences besides abstraction and incorporating new tools. Docker is a useful tool for building applications and deploying applicaitons on other machines.
